%Newtonsys  Solve system f(x) = 0 by Newton's method.

%    Xiterations = Newtonsys(FdF,x0,kmax)

% F(x) and F'(x) are computed by the user-supplied function FdF with the
% call [F,dF] = FdF(x), where F is a vector holding the computed F(x) and
% dF is a matrix holding the computed F'(x).
%
% The starting point is x0.
% 
% The function carries out kmax iterations, and stores all kmax iterations
% as columns on the output matrix Xiterations.
